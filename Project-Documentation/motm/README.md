# Map of the Month
Documentation and data processing scripts for the [Map of the Month](http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/motm.html)

## Documenting Project 
The methodology for each motm project should be documented. The following are some guidelines that might be useful to consider: 

1. [Clone motm repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
	* If repository already exists locally, [pull from upstream remote](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/) to merge any updates
2. Create a new directory in the root following the **YYYY_MM** 4 digit year 2 digit month format  
3. Create sub-directories as necessary. 
	* Example sub-directories could include the following: 
		* data
		* scripts 

## Sharing Work Products via Box
When sharing finished or intermediary content for motm, please consider the guidelines outlined in the [MOTM_Uploads ReadMe](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/k7xl3jkazxm22mria5zyppbajw6gwu4j) 

It's personal preference, but you may also want to clone this directory structure into your local environment when working locally. Upon project completion or if resources need to be shared, copy work from the local directory to the Cloud Box directory.
