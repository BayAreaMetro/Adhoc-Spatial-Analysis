# Bay Area 30 Year Earthquake Risk Projection  

[Asana Project](https://app.asana.com/0/229355710745434/452233978089474) 

### Goal

The goal of this month's map of the month is to convey Bay Area 30 Year Earthquake Risk both in terms of probability of an earthquake occuring anywhere in the Bay Area as well as probability for any given major fault within the region. 

This month's map is a remix of a map produced by the ABAG/MTC Resilience Team, which can be seen below.
