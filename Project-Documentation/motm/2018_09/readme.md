# SB1/Prop6 Pavement Condition Index Projection Analysis 

[Asana Project](https://app.asana.com/0/797943099119526/814801064709349) 

### Goal

This month's map of the month focuses on California Proposition 6 which proposes to repeal Senate Bill 1 (SB1).

Two heat maps that show Pavement Condition Index (PCI) score by jurisdiction grouped into the following categories: 
Poor/Failed (0-49)
At Risk (50-59)
Good/Fair (60-79)
Excellent/Very Good (80-100)

Maps: 
The first map should show Network PCI by jurisdiction for 2017 (Agency - Column C of provided Excel Workbook) 
The second map should show Revised Network PCI 2027 without SB1 - Prop 6 Passage (Agency - Column G of provided Excel Workbook) 

### Contents  

#### Data Sources  
[Final Proposition 6 Impact on Pavement Condition](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/254gktmcwe810au6zxd0t5abctypvq14)  

[Jurisdiction/ Unincorporated TomTom Dataset](https://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6af997969b1b4987bdb3c65c8104fb86#overview)

#### Methodology  
1. Final Proposition 6 Impact on Pavement Condition Index (PCI) workbook stripped and reformatted then converted to csv.  
2. Join PCI csv to Jurisdiction/ Unincorporated TomTom Dataset on PlaceName.  
3. Output new feature class containing join.
4. Symbolize based on PCI_2017, PCI_2027 without SB1 (Prop 6 passes), PCI_2027 with SB1 (Prop 6 fails). 
5. Create three maps depicting existing pavement conditions, projected pavement conditions with SB1, and projected pavement conditions without SB1.
