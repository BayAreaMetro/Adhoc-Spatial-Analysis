[Asana Project](https://app.asana.com/0/797943099119526/814801064709349) 

### Goal

This month's map of the month focuses on California Proposition 6 which proposes to repeal Senate Bill 1.

Two heat maps that show Pavement Condition Index (PCI) score by jurisdiction grouped into the following categories: 
Poor/Failed (0-49)
At Risk (50-59)
Good/Fair (60-79)
Excellent/Very Good (80-100)

Maps: 
The first map should show Network PCI by jurisdiction for 2017 (Agency - Column C of provided Excel Workbook) 
The second map should show Revised Network PCI 2027 without SB1 - Prop 6 Passage (Agency - Column G of provided Excel Workbook)
