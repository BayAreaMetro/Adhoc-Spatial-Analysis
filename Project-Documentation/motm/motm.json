On a negative rate, about one-half the states have not raised their gasoline taxes in more than a decade. Also, by special request of Commissioner Haggerty, I've included a bonus map which represents the proposed BART system that was presented to Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco voters at the election approving construction of the system in November 1962.",

By examining long-range funding allocations for America's most populous 20 metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), the distribution of funding for operations and maintenance (O&M;) versus expansion, as well as roadways versus public transit, can be identified. Aging regions (New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh) are spending large shares of their regional funding on preserving existing road and transit infrastructure; newer regions with rapid growth are pursuing different strategies, some heavily dependent on highway expansion (Denver, Dallas, Phoenix) and others with a more balanced approach incorporating substantial investment in fixed-guideway transit systems (Los Angeles, San Diego).",

Starting in 2003, these two parameters began to diverge, due to a lack of growth in the amount of miles being driven.  This map shows the relationship between total vehicle miles driven and GDP per state in 2011.  According to the recent report \"Distance Driven and Economic Activity in the Individual U.S. States: 1997-2011,\" done by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, the District of Columbia had the highest GDP per distance driven ($30.04/mile), followed by Alaska ($11.16/mile), and New York ($9.16/mile).  Among the lowest states were Mississippi ($2.51/mile), Alabama ($2.75/mile), and New Mexico ($3.12/mile).  The study also found that higher density populations correlated to a higher GDP/mile ratio, which is expected.  But it rather unexpectedly found that states with large land areas correlated to a high level of GDP/mile ratio.",

This amount almost doubles the combined infrastructure investment of the European Union (2.6% GDP) and the United States (2.6% GDP).  In fact, it far exceeds what any other country or region spends; China's infrastructure spending is twice the level of India, and more than four times that of Latin America. In the U.S., the largest share of infrastructure spending is towards Roads, followed by Transit and Water.  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), between 2003 and 2007, public spending on transportation and water infrastructure declined by $23 billion, or 6 percent. That decline, which reflects a decrease in real capital spending, especially by the federal government, stands in contrast to the fairly steady increase in spending for such infrastructure during the previous two decades. In particular, real capital spending on highways, mass transit, and aviation fell markedly even as capital spending on other types of infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as rail and water transportation, water resources, and water supply and wastewater treatment\u00e2\u0080\u0094remained stable or rose.",

The data is based upon traffic volume trends data collected by the U.S. D.O.T data from January 1971 to February 2013.  Since June 2005, vehicle miles driven have fallen 8.75 percent. This decline has remained steady for the past 92 months.  There are several reasons that may be causing this steady downward trend.  It has been suggested that due to rising gas prices, the Great Recession, an aging population led by the Baby Boom generation which is comprised of Americans over the age of 55 who tend to drive less, and quite possibly younger Americans choosing to drive less.  Between 2001 and 2009, the average yearly number of miles driven by 16- to 34-year-olds has dropped 23 percent.Researchers indicate that this trend may be linked to five principal factors:The cost of Driving has increasedThe recent recessionIt is harder to get a license in many statesMore younger people are choosing to live in transit-oriented areas andTechnology is making it easier to go car-freeData Source Information:Traffic Volume Trends is a monthly report based on hourly traffic count data reported by the States.

The study concluded that:Steep employment losses following the Great Recession stalled the steady decentralization of jobs that characterized the early to mid-2000s.  However, by 2010 nearly twice the share of jobs was located at least 10 miles away from downtown (43%) as within 3 miles of downtown (23%).Job losses in industries hit hardest by the downturn, including construction and manufacturing, helped check employment decentralization in the late 2000s.In all but nine of the 100 largest metro areas, the share of jobs located within three miles of downtown declined during the 2000s.Metro areas showing the greatest increase in jobs in the 10-35 miles radius from downtown include: Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale, AZ, San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX, Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos, TX, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, and Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX.Metro areas showing the greatest loss of jobs within the 3 mile radius of downtown include: North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL, Boise City-Nampa, ID, Jackson, MS, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FLSource:Job Sprawl Stalls: The Great Recession and Metropolitan Employment LocationMetropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institute.

A performance index has been prepared to highlight the total number of categories in which each state showed improvement. The darker the shade of green, the more categories of improvement.  The light and dark green labels show the total disbursements per mile ($M) per state.Most states (37 of 50) improved or maintained their performance in five or more categories. And most states (38 of 50) also spent less than the national average, per mile of responsibility. Interestingly, those states that spent the most money did not make the most improvement, and states with relatively few resources also made progress. For instance, California spent about twice as much as the average state (per mile of responsibility), but its performance improved in just two of the seven measures (deficient bridges and fatality rate). Hawaii and New York also spent between 2 and 2.5 times the national average but improved in just three of seven measures. Conversely, 10 states (led by North Dakota, Virginia and Missouri) spent less than the national average per mile of responsibility but improved on all seven measures, and only one state (Florida) improved on all seven measures and spent more than the national average.",

This program provides grants to every state, certain local communities, and other organizations to purchase foreclosed or abandoned homes and to rehabilitate, resell, or redevelop these homes in order to stabilize neighborhoods and stem the decline of house values of neighboring homes. This map scores neighborhoods in the bay area on a scale of 1 to 20 where 20 indicates areas in the highest 20% of risk nationwide for home foreclosures and abandonment.  1 indicates areas with lowest risk. This ranking is based upon the following factors developed by HUD:    whether or not loans are high cost or highly leveraged in the neighborhood    change in home values for the metropolitan, or non-metropolitan portion of the state    unemployment rate for the county in 2008, and  the change in unemployment in the county between 2007 and 2008. HUD is providing its data on estimated foreclosures (based on risk) and vacancy data to assist state and local governments in their efforts to target the communities and neighborhoods with the greatest needs.  HUD recommends that if states and local governments have local data, such as county data on foreclosure filings, that those data also be given serious consideration in identifying areas of greatest needs.Map Source: http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/nsp.html",

Pavement condition is represented by the Pavement Condition Index, which was developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers, ranges from a like-new condition of 100 to a failed condition of 0. The average PCI in the San Francisco Bay Area is 66. Pavement deterioration is primarily caused by distress from vehicle weight and aggravated by weather conditions. Local funding priorities also play a significant role in the condition of a road network. As an example, El Cerrito recently passed a self-help tax specifically for road and pavement preservation. As a result, nearly all of the road segments within the city limits are either in Excellent or Very Good Condition. In other areas, targeted improvements can stretch limited funds. The cities of Orinda recently passed funding measures for their street network and started by focusing on arterial streets.

Today, the state is still pulling in foreign immigrants, but the percentage of American-born transplants has shrunk significantly as fewer people move into the state. In 1960, half of California residents were born in another U.S. state. Today, that's down to 18 percent. There are growing pools of Californians in nearly every state.

According to 2014 Census data, 39.1 percent of the U.S. population lived in those counties, often within miles of the coast.Map 2 highlights the largest and smallest counties in the U.S. Roughly fifty percent of the U.S. population lives in the country's 144 largest counties, while the roughly other 50 percent lives in 2,998 counties. Map 3 compares America's two largest counties (Los Angeles and Downtown Chicago) with the 14 smallest states.Map 4 compares the population of these two counties with 1,437 of the country's smallest counties. Nearly 5 percent of America's population lives in the counties covering downtown L.A. and downtown Chicago, which is the same proportion as those that live in the country's 1,437 smallest counties.

In fact, the past five months were the warmest start to a year on record since 1880. It's a continuation of trends that made 2014 the most blistering year for the surface of the planet. The stifling start to 2015 may be just the beginning. Thirteen of the 14 hottest years are in the 21st century, and 2015 is on track to break the heat record again. It isn't even close.The National Weather Service predicts that a pattern of unusually warm waters in the Pacific Ocean, known as El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o, has an 85 percent chance of persisting through the 2015-2016 winter. And this El Nino could be a big one. A strong El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o doesn't guarantee record-breaking heat, but combined with the general trend of global warming, that possibility is looking increasingly likely. El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o conditions transfer heat that's been building in the ocean into the atmosphere, affecting weather around the world. A protracted El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o could bring relief to California's unprecedented drought in the form of heavy rains, but would likely add another year to the rising stack of broken temperature records.",

If you're poor and live in the San Francisco area, it's better to be in Contra Costa County than in San Francisco County or Alameda County. Not only that, the younger you are when you move to Contra Costa, the better you will do on average. Children who move at earlier ages are less likely to become single parents, more likely to go to college and more likely to earn more. Every year a poor child spends in Contra Costa County adds about $160 to his or her annual household income at age 26, compared with a childhood spent in the average American county. Over the course of a full childhood, which is up to age 20 for the purposes of this analysis, the difference adds up to about $3,200, or 12 percent, more in average income as a young adult. These findings, particularly those that show how much each additional year matters, are from a new study by Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren that has huge consequences on how we think about poverty and mobility in the United States.",

On average, drivers will spend double the time in the car for most large metropolitan areas across the world during the evening commute alone. The average commuter spent an extra 100 hours a year traveling during the evening rush hour. In Los Angeles (Ranked 1st in the U.S. and 10th Worldwide), a 30 minute commute in the evening will take 54 minutes due to congestion, an extra 92 hours annually. Commuters in the Bay Area are only slightly better off than their counter parts in LA. The measured congestion in San Francisco (Ranked 2nd in the U.S. and 26th Worldwide) is at 34%, while San Jose (Ranked 6th in the US and 51st Worldwide) is at 30%. TomTom roadway congestion is measured as an increase in overall travel times when compared to the posted speed limits on roadways. For example, a Congestion Level of 12% corresponds to 12% longer travel times. The full report and press release can be viewed here: http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/about",

The region's lower-income neighborhoods and its outer suburbs were most impacted by the foreclosure crisis and therefore experienced the sharpest drop in homeownership rates. These communities include, Oakland, Hayward and San Ramon. On average, in 2013, the Bay Area had fewer homeowners than in 2005.

	"description": "This month's chart highlights the growing divide between the price of gas and the taxes imposed for its use. When gasoline topped $4 a gallon, opponents of an increase in the gas tax argued that prices were already too high. Now that the average price of regular gas has dropped to under $2.50 a gallon, the anti-tax environment that pervades Washington shows little support for increasing the gas tax to finance the upkeep of the nation's roadways and public transit systems. This no-win dynamic is frustrating to advocates who had hoped falling gas prices might reinvigorate the idea of raising the gas tax, which they view as one of the simplest, fairest and most efficient ways to pay for transportation repairs and improvements. The latest discussions about raising the gas tax come as the Energy Information Administration estimates that the average American household will spend at least $550 less on gasoline next year than it did in 2014, a result of lower prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks that can travel farther on fewer gallons. The last time the gasoline tax was raised was in 1993, and even that 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase was not initially dedicated to transportation repair and capital improvements, but rather was part of President Clinton's budget-deficit reduction plan. That revenue stream was redirected to the federal Highway Trust Fund in 1997 Back then, the 18.4-cent tax on every gallon represented about 16 percent of the pump price. If the gas tax had kept pace with inflation it would be 30.1 cents today. The Trust Fund now faces a major decline of an estimated $160 billion deficit over the next 10 years.",

From a transportation perspective, one clear takeaway is that you could drive coast-to-coast without ever setting foot in a Clinton County.  The second map comes courtesy of the Brookings Institution, and it tells a dramatically different story.  While Secretary Clinton carried 2,000 fewer counties than Mr. Trump, her blue counties represent nearly two-thirds of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Finally, the third map introduces some nuance to the stark contrast of the two other pictures.  It depicts county-by-county results like the first map, but shows the margin of victory in a range of red and blue colors.  The most striking thing to me about the third map is how many purple counties there are, where the vote margin was +/-10% for either Trump or Clinton.  In other words, our closely divided county once again proved just how closely divided it is.  My Christmas wish:  that we can start emphasizing the close part more than the divided one. ",

In expensive regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area and the Southern California coastal region, the Real Cost Budget, a monthly budget calculation of what is needed to meet basic needs, can range from 32% to 48% more (depending on family type) than in less expensive counties such as Kern, Tulare, and Kings counties.

Waze, in turn, will receive the FSP's highway incident information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including crashes and stalls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to share with its users. Together, both will have more data and be better able to provide timely assistance to Bay Area drivers. The map in Attachment 4 represents a snapshot of the incidents reported by FSP and Waze users during peak congestion hours in the nine-county Bay Area. Traffic incidents and assists from the FSP program are shown in blue, while reported incidents from Waze are shown in yellow. Incidents have been aggregated along major corridors throughout the region in an attempt to compare the number of incidents reported by Waze users with the total number of assists handled by the FSP program. Alameda County (32%) has the largest share of the total number of incidents during the peak congestion hours, followed by Santa Clara (26%), Contra Costa (15%) and San Mateo (12%). ",

	"description": "This month's map highlights a recent study released by Inrix Inc. that examines traffic congestion in over 1,000 cities - 240 in the U.S. - across 38 countries. The study reveals that the U.S. is ranked as the most congested developed country in the world, with drivers spending an average of 42 hours a year in traffic during peak hours. According to this study, the direct and indirect costs of congestion to all U.S. drivers amounts to nearly $300 billion in 2016, an average of $1,400 per driver.  U.S. cities dominated the top 10 most congested cities globally, with Los Angeles (first), New York (third), San Francisco (fourth), Atlanta (eighth) and Miami (10th) each dealing with an economic drain on the city upwards of $2.5 billion caused by traffic congestion. Los Angeles commuters spent an average of 104 hours last year in traffic jams during peak congestion hours more than any other city in the world. This contributed to congestion costing drivers in Los Angeles $2,408 each and the city as a whole $9.6 billion from direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the value of fuel and time wasted, and indirect costs refer to freight and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic, which are passed on to households through higher prices.

	"description": "This map shows median home values plotted against median household income in an effort to illustrate where the least affordable housing in the U.S. is located. The Bay Area, not surprisingly, has some of the least affordable housing in the country \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both in absolute terms, and in terms relative to income. In San Francisco proper, the median home value is $800,000 with a median income of $81,000, giving a price-to-income ratio of nearly 10 to 1. In Marin County, the median home value is $815,000 with a median income of $93,000. This ratio is 8.8 times the median income of the county. In Silicon Valley, housing is still pricey, but many people are able to make up for it with higher incomes: San Mateo County has a ratio of 8.3, and Santa Clara County has a ratio of 7.3. ",
