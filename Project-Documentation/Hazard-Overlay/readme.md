## Define the Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to build an application that allows users to search for an address, and receive feedback on whether that address is impacted by certain geological hazards.

The goal is to be able to say that an address is positively impacted by a geological hazard if all or part of the parcel intersects that hazard.

In order to accomplish this, a dataset needs to be developed based on parcel features, with attributes indicating whether each parcel is in/out of a specific hazard.
