# Draft Documentation
Geospatial procedure and tabular analysis of OBAG and TIP investments in PDAs/TPAs vs. investments outside of those areas.

% OBAG 2 funds in PDAs / outside of PDAs (using a distance buffer that we determine, rather than relying on the CMA’s judgment for whether or not a project supported a PDA)
% TIP funds in PDAS (includes OBAG) / outside of PDAs
$ invested (OBAG and/or TIP) in each PDA (so we can see what PDAs are actually being heavily invested in, vs those that are not).

For example:  
| PDAs only - No Buffer	| OBAG $ 100% within, partially within, or adjacent to a PDA | OBAG $ outside of PDA |	Total |
