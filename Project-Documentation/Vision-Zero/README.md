## Define the Problem Statement

- Create a polyline feature class using TomTom road network data and SWITRS/TIMS data that joins 'high injury' attributes from SWITRS/TIMS data to the road network. 
- Provide a summary network which extracts 'high injury' cooridors from the entire TomTom road network for the Bay Area
- Summarize SWITRS/TIMS data by Census Block 

## Data Sources

- TomTom Other Areas 
- TomTom Street Network (mn_nw_BayArea)
- [SWITRS/TIMS (2006-2016)](Data/Bay-Area-Accidents-2006-2016.csv) 

## Analysis Parameters

- [SWITRS/TIMS (2006-2016)](Data/Bay-Area-Accidents-2006-2016.csv) 

|Variable         |Description                                                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|killed           |Number of people killed (includes pedestrians and motorists)         |
|Sevinj           |Number of people severly injured (includes pedestrians and motorists)|
|Accident Year    |Year accident was reported                                           |
