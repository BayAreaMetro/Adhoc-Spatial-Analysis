## Define the Problem Statement

- Create a polyline feature class using TomTom road network data and SWITRS/TIMS data that joins 'high injury' attributes from SWITRS/TIMS data to the road network. 
- Provide a summary network which extracts 'high injury' cooridors from the entire TomTom road network for the Bay Area
- Summarize SWITRS/TIMS data by Census Block
