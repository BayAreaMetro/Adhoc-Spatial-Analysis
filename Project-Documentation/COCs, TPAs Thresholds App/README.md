### Define the Problem Statement
Build mapping application for CASA â€“ The Committee to House the Bay Area. Application will attempt to explore communities with high poverty and high minority rates. Baseline thresholds are (1) 30% or greater than 'Low Income (< 200% Federal Poverty Level - FPL)', and (2) 70% or greater than 'Minority population[s]'. Threshold "levers" to be incorperated which will have the capability to manipulate the 'poverty' and 'people of color' thresholds to gauge inclusion/exclusion of certain communites for potential regulatory exemptions.

## Analysis Parameters

## Methodology
Filter COCs to reflect geographies with (1) 30% or greater than 'Low Income (< 200% Federal Poverty Level - FPL)', and (2) 70% or greater than 'Minority population[s]'  
ie. SQL: pct_minori >= 0.7 And pct_below2 >= 0.3
