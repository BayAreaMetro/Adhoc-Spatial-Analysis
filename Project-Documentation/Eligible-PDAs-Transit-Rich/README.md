![Existing PDA](https://mtcdrive.box.com/shared/static/mkt7fgz1kyfv1gaszrwmj295hkcbly0m.png)

##### Eligible PDA based on Passenger Rail and 15 minute or less bus frequency
![Eligible PDA - 15 minute transit headway](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/700dwh1o2pynva6puik3pevca9hggp3u.png)

##### Eligible PDA based bus frequency greater than 15 minute but less than 30 mins
![Eligible PDA - 30 minute transit headway](https://mtcdrive.box.com/shared/static/9mqjus62l3gnl4wb4pzqz2y8ktktidgr.png)

The Eligible PDAs were calculated for the purposes of Santa Clara County Outreach Meetings where Priority Development Areas (PDAs) were dicussed. Prior to meeting the 30min eligible PDAs were not determined.

### Define the Problem Statement  

Areas within a 1/2 mile from a high frequency transit stop are where land use development are prioritized. If the area around transit stops changes, how do we account for those modifications? What is the definition of 'frequent transit'? In terms of this request and PDA determination, 'frequent transit' refers to a station/stop severed by transit '15 minutes or less' on weekdays.

VTA Next Network  
Current/Existing Priority Development Areas (PDAs)  
Current/Existing Transit Priority  Areas (TPAs)  
Current/Existing Priority Conservation Areas (TPAs)  
    
## Analysis Parameters  
 underdevelopment 

## Methodology  
1. Eligible PDA _15min = Buffer the 15 minute headway bus stops
2. Erase existing PDA from Eligible PDA _15min
3. Eligible PDA _30min = Buffer the bus stops with headway greater than 15mins and less than 30mins
4. Erase Eligible PDA _15min from Eligible PDA _30min 

## Expected Outcomes  
Inform the 2050 Plan Bay Area Outreach process of existing and eligible Priority Development Areas.
