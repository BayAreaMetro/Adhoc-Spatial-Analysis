## Analysis Parameters 

### Regional Growth Framework Update

PDAs, PPAs and PCAs were created following the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Growth Framework Update. A summary of key changes to the Regional Growth Framework as well as an overview of current and updated Regional Growth Framework designations can be found at the link below.
