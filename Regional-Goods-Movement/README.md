# Northern California Megaregion Goods Movement Analysis & Mapping 

The Goods Movement program at MTC provides a regional, coordinating framework from which funding and planning priorities are developed. The current planning framework is the San Francisco Goods Movement Plan, adopted in 2016, which prioritizes sustainable, global competitiveness in freight. The primary strategies for realizing this goal are through increasing capacity at the Port of Oakland, increasing access to industrial land region-wide, improving efficiency and emissions of urban deliveries, and reducing adverse impacts of freight movement along the highway and rail corridors.
