# Documenting Content 

The purpose of this page is to define types of documentation and documentation requirements for each type. Content documentation can be split into two types: **basic documentation** and **detailed documentation**. 

## Basic Documentation 

 - Title: State what it is.  Often times, this will simply be the name of the layer, or association of layers.
 - Summary: A one-line description of the content
     - **Draft Content**
         - Include "draft" in all capital letters at beginning of summary: DRAFT or [DRAFT]
     - **Final Content**
         - Remove "draft" from the summary and include a year statement for when the content was created at end of summary: examples - "_Content_Title_ was created in 2018" or "_Content_Title_ was created in April 2018"
 - Description: Additional information that supports summary. 
     - Link to project documentation (if any).
     - ~~Project or program content was created to support.~~
     - Content owner - the person responsible for the data. ~~project or program the content supports.~~
     - Source Files (if available): Link to source files used to generate content. This will generally apply only to static content such as images or pdfs. 
     - Content source (if available): Link to the webpage, portal, or download site if content is owned by an organization other than MTC/ABAG. 
 - Credits (Attribution): Acknowledge the source of the content and include the year content was created (if known). (ex. Federal Highway Administration - Freight Analysis Framework, 2012) 
 - Tags: Related keywords to support content discovery See: [Content Tagging Strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
     - **If content is considered draft include "draft" as a tag**
