## Creating Groups 

Groups allow AGOL users to manage a collection of maps, scenes, layers, analytics, and apps. Groups can be created by theme, or topic, or project. When creating groups, the purpose and audience of the group is worth considering. At MTC, our audience(s) can generally be categorized into two groups – [working groups](#create-working-groups), and [broadcast groups](#create-broadcast-groups).

### Create Working Groups

Working Group – for sharing in-progress work with a specific group of collaborators (your work colleagues). These groups will be ad-hoc groups which will have owners other than the DataViz Team or content curator. Audience for these groups will be limited to members of the group.

### Create Broadcast Groups 

**Broadcast groups are created and managed only by the DataViz team's content curators**

Broadcast Group – for sharing finished content with an identified audience (everyone, our organization, or a specific collection of individuals) Broadcast groups will be organized by the following topic areas: 

   | Content Topic Areas  |               |          |
   |----------------------|---------------|----------|
   | Administrative       | Demographic   | Policy   |
   | Transportation       | Environmental | Projects |
   
   | Enterprise Topic Areas |                               |
   |------------------------|-------------------------------|
   | Administrative         | Cadastral                     |
   | Environmental          | Hydrography                   |
   | Planning               | Structures and Infrastructure |
   | Surface Overlay        | Transportation                |

### Group Naming Conventions

It is important to clearly distinguish between working and broadcast groups for project participants since they may be members of both. Even though group permissions support using a single group for in-progress content (shared to group only) and finished items (shared to group AND organization), it is difficult for the project team to keep this straight since they can see both sets of items. 

A good way to organize this is to use **two groups** and a naming convention for your **working groups (in progress content)** and **broadcast groups (final content)**.  For example:

- Broadcast group: "My Mapping Project"
- Working group: "My Mapping Project (Private - Working)"
- Final web map: "My Web Map"
- In-progress web map: "My Web Map (Draft)"
