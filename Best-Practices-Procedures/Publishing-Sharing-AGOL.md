## Publishing Content to Internal or External Audiences

### Draft Web Layers

1. Publish web layer to AGOL through ArcGIS Pro, following guide on [sharing with ArcGIS Pro](AGOL-Technical-Resources.md#publishing-web-layers-to-agol-with-arcgis-pro)
2. Ensure web layer meets minimum basic documentation requirements for draft content. See [basic documentation requirements](Documentation.md#basic-documentation) 
    - Name, summary, and tag field are required to be completed before you can publishing to AGOL from ArcGIS Pro.
3. Select sharing options:  
    - To share with **only** a select group of stakeholders, share content to a [working group](Creating-Groups.md#create-working-groups) only. Don't share with **organization** or **public**. If an appropriate working group does not exist, create one following guidelines for [creating working groups](Creating-Groups.md#create-working-groups) 
    - To share with a wider audience, or a stakeholder not part of the MTC AGOL Organization, share content to **organization**, **public**, or both if necessary. 
4. Confirm spatial extent for all web layers prior to publishing. If spatial extent is larger than your target extent (ex California extent when web layer is Bay Area centric), follow guide on [Recalculating Feature Class Extent](AGOL-Technical-Resources.md#recalculate-feature-class-extent) 

### Draft Web Maps 

1. Ensure web map meets minimum basic documentation requirements for draft content. See [basic documentation requirements](Documentation.md#basic-documentation)
2. Select sharing options:  
    - To share with **only** a select group of stakeholders, share content to a [working group](Creating-Groups.md#create-working-groups) only. Don't share with **organization** or **public**. If an appropriate working group does not exist, create one following guidelines for [creating working groups](Creating-Groups.md#create-working-groups) 
    - To share with a wider audience, or a stakeholder not part of the MTC AGOL Organization, share content to **organization**, **public**, or both if necessary.
